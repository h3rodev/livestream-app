# Changelog

## v0.3.0 – Admin–Camera Recording Sync & Audio Mixer Fix
**Date:** 2025-11-24

### Added
- Bi-directional recording control between Admin and Camera:
  - Admin can start/stop per-camera recordings from the V1–V5 slots.
  - Camera can start/stop recording locally and the Admin UI mirrors the recording state.
- `live-state` signalling:
  - Admin designates a single camera as LIVE.
  - Only the selected camera shows a LIVE indicator on the Camera UI.
- Automatic upload of camera recordings to the server via `/api/upload-recording` with per-camera folders and JSON metadata.

### Changed
- Audio mixer behaviour on Admin:
  - When the mixer is enabled, all currently connected camera streams are now attached automatically.
  - Each active camera appears as a separate audio source with its own gain control.
- Admin slot status logic:
  - Explicit separation of `offline`, `connecting`, `online`, and `LIVE` states.
  - Exactly one camera at a time is marked as `LIVE`, all other connected cameras show as `online`.

### Fixed
- Recording state desynchronisation:
  - Stopping a recording on Camera now correctly stops the corresponding recording on Admin (and vice versa) without event loops.
- Inconsistent audio source list:
  - Audio panel no longer misses already-connected cameras when enabling the mixer after streams are live.

### Files touched (high-level)
- `server/src/index.js`
  - Added `live-state`, `record-control`, and `record-state` events.
  - Centralised upload handling for camera recordings.
- `admin-ui/src/App.vue`
  - Integrated audio mixer attachment for existing camera streams.
  - Implemented synced recording logic and refined slot status handling.
- `camera-ui/src/App.vue`
  - Added LIVE indicator and recording control wiring from Admin.
  - Implemented auto-upload and local download of camera recordings.
